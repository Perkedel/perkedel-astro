Streissand is when you attempt to censor the info but turns out the info becomes popular & angered about. Hydra is when you solve this thing, but then 2 problem arise, just like the beast is. Cobra is when you want to destroy it this trouble, and when you felt succeeded, turns out another people breed the thing that was your problem, and so you stopped destroying it and now when people dropped it out, it goes even wilder than ever before.

# in event of git merge conflict
use VScode and Github desktop!
## New
- cease all works
- commit and push new commit to your GitHub now.
- go to conflict solving branch. pull the last commit from main to here.
- pull from upstream while you're at conflict solving branch
- see GitHub Desktop. the conflict window will popup. open all conflict files in VScode.
- wait.
- after blue and green field appear, open comparison to map your changes and the upstream.
- review, and bring your changed (the green field) to upstream pull (blue field)
- or anything that leaves current work there while adding new things.
- after you've carefully brought all of them, `accept incoming change` or anything that bake all current & new things together.
- repeat for the rest of the part and files
- after all conflict solved, `Commit Merge` in GitHub desktop.
- go back to main branch again.
- pull the newly solved conflict commits from `conflict solving` branch to `main`.
- push while you're at `main` now!

## legacyed
- make sure to backup your last mod commit into a new branch first.
- pull your latest commit from main to the conflict solving branch
- try to checkout the new topic branch that conflict with the default branch where you supposed to merge all topic into default. 
- carefully open Github desktop. the conflict window appears. 
- resolve the conflict, by click each `open in visual studio code` in each file conflicted. 
- carefully compare the change and bring your change from green field into the incoming blue field. 
- after you've carefully manually copying over your mod code to blue field, go to the top of green, click `accept incoming`.
- after all conflict resolved you can commit merge. yay

Note: in Game Banana, mods that did not have license written will set to CC4.0-BY-NC-ND by default (marked by `Warning: presumably no license so default`). We believe that with ND circle legally prevents anyone to yoink such mods without asking permission. However, such statement is vague, due to the gray area like e.g. SF2. in any case, review the details and yoink with caution.

This asset has been removed & moved to Scrap due to fear of copyright strike again since that mod got copyright struck. not because of license of this asset. Ah peck! I didn't have the latest 1.2 version. Archiver bot should've been vigilant. PECK. At least we do have Redsty Phoenix standalone gf, yeah.. idk.

**dislcaimer**: above list are no way meant to insult, defame, or threat authors of the mods listed. Perkedel requires all contributor from all tiers, roles, etc. to be transparent not only what have been yoinked, but also deyoinked assets, as well as the reason behind each deyoinks and removal (also including the foreshadowing which means mods that wish to be yoinked but ND circled license in the way). for those author that got the mod removed, feel free to make change in your licensing in case you disagree with the removal.

~~If you wish to grant us permission to yoink your mods here, please change your license that at least removes offending circle (such as `No Derivative`). Perkedel do not accept exclusive grant certificate, or even bribe absolutely, due to nature of Perkedel that importance people more than ownself, especially in terms of motto and service (violation like granting exclusive grant either to us or someonw will cause your name blacklisted for particular sector which is fnf mods. your mod will be blacklisted from being yoinked). We require that you in full heart declared whether or not should anyone use your assets, code script, and stuff.~~ Permission asking directive is active. read `PERMISSION.md` for more info.

for more detail about our statement regarding the `No Derivative` is death wish, feel free to read here  
https://gamebanana.com/questions/11159?post=9179454 

# what the peck why there's that one license there? / Have you got permission?
Okay let me clarify it this Creative Commons licenses here. Let's see what I understand.

any of license available with CC allows me to **yoink** it this to here. now, because there's `BY` (Attribution), I must credit. Of course, I cannot disagree with anything. everyone must know where to download and what the peck title is that.

the `SA` (share alike) is about this. so if I just inserted to my mods here, that doesn't mean anything. **HOWEVER**, if I happened to edit that part with `SA`, I then must also license that particular remix (not whole mods) the same license as the original.

the `NC` (No commercial) is notorious. I think, if this mod contains any asset with `NC`, then this whole mod cannot be deployed to arcade machine. Well, you then have to bring your own this mod there. Because No commercial gain thingy idk.

the `ND` (No Derivative) is death wish. Again **this does not affect entire mod** hopefully. I can only just yoink (because Creative Commons), but I am allowed to remix those particular assets with `ND` at all. Just yoink that's it.  
EDIT: **NOPE!!! NO YOINKS ALLOWED**. I Think that's all death wish.

and yeah, that's why I think inserting those mods without permission **should and must be** okay, as long you understand the licenses that had their permissions and restriction in it. Basically, make sure you credit. second, if it has `=` (No Derivative), do not remix that but yoink is okay. third if it has ~~`$`~~ (No commercial), then don't deploy this mod officially in arcade machine (if you have to, then you must remove all of the offending assets with No commecial first, or ask negotiate commercial permission from the authors involved making the assets). fourth, if it has `🔄` (Share Alike) then if you edited the particular asset, this new remix (not the whole mods) must be licensed same as original is (you can keep licensing rest of your mod anything less restrictive).

right, so I assume you didn't put any license into it for those are CC4.0-BY-NC-ND, because if you didn't write it then it uses that default license, CC4.0-BY-NC-ND. idk about you, but maybe it's recommended to have at least a bit of knowledge of license here.

I'm not legal expert at all. I just, not into law games, but concerns it this part of a thing. And c'mon, why we go here? weren't we supposed to make more mods or play more mods already? why bother if someone yoinked your mods beside if they don't credited it?

# wtf gamebanana?! what vagueness is this?!?!
## Requirement of permission
https://gamebanana.com/threads/218927 Section 3.7 `No Proof Of Permission`

[![]("https://gamebanana.com/questions/embeddables/11159?type=large")](https://gamebanana.com/questions/11159)

okay, so what I interpret is that, yoinks are not okay at all. is that right? Yeah I get it, but for what license?

you see, all mods who haven't written license will be default to Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution No Commercial No Derivatives (CC4.0-BY-NC-ND). By standard of most part of the earth, you can yoink pictures from the internet even without permission that are licensed Creative Commons to any creation, as long you put credit clearly in the creation description, as stated in `BY` Attribution in this CC.

and sometimes I can find mods licensed seriously, humbly, permissively, free culture license compliants. such as Do whatever the fck you want thingy.. Now what with these? we can just put it in right? yeah we credit of course, even it is public domain.

Yeah, I might become modpack here and there, but we got original contexts in here.

ah peck this poop. let's scrap the test files. just to be safe people.

### edit! ND circled Creative Common license
- https://gamebanana.com/questions/11159?post=9179454
- https://gamebanana.com/questions/11159?post=9181884
- https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ 

NOPE! don't yoink that. period. you cannot yoink ND circled mods without asking permission. Transformative content? idk maybe still need permission. yeah just don't take it. find anything else that has no ND circle on it.

## Recompile must be Open Source too, but why not the old one too?
https://gamebanana.com/threads/218927 Section 3.10 `Recompiles`

I may sound like a *karen on the loose that worthy canceling everywhere*. but hear me out:

I believe you should consider enforcing that law on older mods too as well, well eventually, not in instant. Yeah after time elapsed there enforcing for the new mods as of the date stated, then you should consider enforcing that too on older mods.

of course, kindly contact the submitters first. give them time for maybe, a month! no response, withhold. I think that's the good plan idk if not wrong.
