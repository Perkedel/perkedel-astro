    <!-- Plagiarizer / Sang Penjiplak miniseries
    tells story of a worker division at Taman Seru, Dasandim. This is a special division for sculpting infrastructure decoration to looks like in a photo.
    They saw the photo or any reference object, then rescale sculpt them as detail as possible.
    The division is so good, that they've expanded the format choices.
    One day, a new advent of AIs & their machination automatas slowly replacing them. from 3D Printing, down to the Tracing AI, also just by looking at a photo, all in just 1 computer.
    But thankfully, Arenod Sediron & DNB affiliates were under attack from various Artist who imposed dystopic rules & censorships against Enjoyers.
    the DNB brought those unfortunately obselete division to work for them in a whole brand new format, yet still the same purpose. is to Plagiarize / Jiplak. 

    So, once upon a time, You were given a picture, an object, and an installations. You were told to rescale sculpt this to make it looks like the reference installation. And you did.
    But now, the Steam & Industrialization Era has finished, go to the brand new Era of Cognitive. Where a machine is now the one that do all of these steps & jobs, then to another machine that will build it.
    Then what you'd be? That's right. Revenge. You were doing this for a boss & a few customers. But now, you'll do this once again, this time, entire universe amount of customers who unfortunately got missile struck mentally.
    And as usual, you pass the updated version craft down.

    So. You like to copy homeworks right? It's very simple. It's just screwed up one one context, but needed in this context.
    How do you do this? Well, Take the reference. Look at its detail. Note each and every corner of the reference and save it.
    Now when you got to rebuild it, take the note again, and rebuild with the detail you just noted. It's that simple.

    in the Finale, use above but add these after:
    But.. are we going to do this the same way, when turns out.. technology, can be our friend either way? And you just saw.. 
    indeed. A homework therefore must be copied (because you've been Blocked).

    He ordered the ambush knowing our mission there.
    Here are the result we got.

    It's okay. These are all we need. There's not much going on since long anyway.
